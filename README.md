# Packet-Level Intrusion Detection

This project uses supervised machine learning to detect post-exploitation activity at the packet level in network traffic. By simulating a real-world IRC backdoor exploit, it builds and trains a binary classifier that distinguishes between normal and malicious packets.

## üîç Project Overview

In 2010, a backdoored version of `UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1` was distributed through the official site. This backdoor allowed unauthenticated remote command execution via IRC. In this project, the vulnerability was actively exploited in a controlled lab using Metasploit, and both benign and post-exploitation traffic were captured and analyzed.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- **Python**, **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì for model development
- **TShark** (CLI for Wireshark) ‚Äì for feature extraction from `.pcap` files
- **Metasploit**, **Kali Linux**, **Metasploitable 2** ‚Äì to simulate attacks
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì chosen for its simplicity, speed, and interpretability

## üìÅ Dataset

> üß™ Custom-generated from real packet captures

- Traffic generated from both:
  - **Normal sessions**: FTP, ping, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, VNC, SMB
  - **Post-exploitation sessions**: Remote shell via UnrealIRCd backdoor, running enumeration and recon commands
- `.pcap` files processed using `tshark` to extract structured features

**Extracted features include:**
- `frame.time_delta`, `frame.len`, `ip.proto`, `ip.ttl`
- `tcp.srcport`, `tcp.dstport`, `tcp.flags`, `tcp.seq`, `tcp.ack`
- `tcp.len`, `tcp.window_size`, `udp.length`, etc.

## ü§ñ Model

A **logistic regression classifier** was trained to distinguish between normal and post-exploitation packets using extracted features.

**Model Evaluation:**
- **Accuracy:** 92.3%
- **Precision:** 92.7%
- **Recall:** 96.9%
- **F1 Score:** 94.7%
- **ROC-AUC:** 95.3%

Cross-validated over 5 folds with a mean score of **91.95%**, showing strong generalization.

## üìå Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates packet-level classification with simple ML models
- Shows how real attack simulations can drive realistic datasets
- Can serve as a baseline or feature engineering template for intrusion detection systems (IDS)

## üîÑ Future Work

- Introduce session-level aggregation (flow-based analysis)
- Explore advanced models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost)
- Handle imbalanced data with sampling strategies
- Deploy model into a live traffic sniffer for real-time detection
